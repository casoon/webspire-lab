description: Static performance patterns for Astro sites — responsive images, CSS containment, minimal client JS, font loading, and Core Web Vitals targets. Use when writing or reviewing code to prevent performance issues (image sizing, lazy loading, bundle splitting). For live profiling and measurement with Chrome DevTools, use web-perf instead.

# Web performance

## Images

### Responsive variants

Generate multiple widths (e.g. 378 w, 756 w, 1200 w) in WebP. Source images at 1024×1024 for blog teasers, 1200×630 for OG images.

### Lazy loading

```html
<img src="image.webp" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="756" height="504" alt="…" />
```

Only hero / above-the-fold images use `loading="eager"`. Always set `width` and `height` to prevent CLS.

### Format

Prefer WebP (or AVIF for larger hero images). Let Astro's image service handle format negotiation where possible.

## CSS performance

### `content-visibility` for long pages

```css
.article-card {
  content-visibility: auto;
  contain-intrinsic-size: 0 300px;
}
```

Browsers skip rendering of off-screen cards; `contain-intrinsic-size` prevents layout shift.

### CSS containment

```css
.card { contain: layout paint style; }
```

Isolates layout and paint calculations to the element.

### Animation cost

- Avoid `filter: blur()` on moving elements.
- Use `transform: translate3d()` for GPU compositing.
- Keep `will-change` to the minimum of elements that actually need it.
- Prefer CSS `animation-timeline: view()` over JS scroll handlers.

## JavaScript

### Minimize client JS

Astro renders zero JS by default — keep it that way.

- Use `<script>` only when truly needed.
- Prefer CSS-only solutions: `:has()`, `<details>`, popover, `<dialog>`.
- Hydrate islands with `client:visible` or `client:idle` instead of `client:load`.

### Scroll handlers

```javascript
// Bad — runs every scroll frame
window.addEventListener('scroll', handler);

// Better — passive
window.addEventListener('scroll', handler, { passive: true });

// Best — CSS scroll-driven animation, no JS
/* .element { animation-timeline: view(); } */
```

## Font loading

```css
@import '@fontsource/inter/latin-400.css';
```

- Self-host via `@fontsource` — no external requests, optimal caching.
- `font-display: swap` is already set by `@fontsource`.
- Subset to the scripts you actually need (`latin`, `latin-ext`, etc.).

## Build optimization

- Run `@casoon/astro-post-audit` after the build to validate assets, duplicates, and structure.
- Review Vite's bundle output for large chunks: unintended npm packages in client bundles, duplicate component instances, inline SVGs that should be external.

## Core Web Vitals

| Metric | Target | Common fix |
|---|---|---|
| LCP | < 2.5 s | Preload hero image, inline critical CSS |
| CLS | < 0.1 | Explicit `width`/`height` on images, `contain-intrinsic-size` for off-screen cards |
| INP | < 200 ms | Move work off main thread, reduce JS, prefer CSS interactions |

## Edge / Cloudflare

- Static assets: automatic edge caching.
- Workers: minimize cold starts — avoid heavy npm deps in Worker entry.
- Images: use cache-control headers consistent with build fingerprints.
- Sharp is not available on Workers — use Astro's `noop` image service there.

## Review checklist

- Above-the-fold image preloaded; below-the-fold lazy.
- All images have explicit `width`/`height`.
- No JS framework shipped for a component that could be pure HTML/CSS.
- Islands hydrated with the lightest directive that works.
- Fonts self-hosted, subset, `font-display: swap`.
- Core Web Vitals measured on a realistic field run, not just lab.
